## Welcome to Movie Manager

This is an angular 1.5X project laying on top of .NET WEB API and alot of self sacrifice ;)
There is a test in the unit test project that will build out a database for you. just update the config with your own connection string.

### Whats the state of things?

There are a few outstanding items. If anyone wants to pull and take a stab at it, they are welcome to!
1. Authentication
2. Adding movies
3. Test coverage for the API layer and e2e for FE functionality.
4. Need to apply a design template or do something terrific with bootstrap.
